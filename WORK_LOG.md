| September 11 | 12-12:30pm  | I brainstormed some ideas for algorithms on paper. I realized that if I can find out how to find the number of disconnected subgraphs, I could easily solve the problem. Then I tried to implement an algorithm where I figure out how many subgraphs there are by looping through the cities 2d array. As I began writing this work log, I came up with another idea for how to do the project that is similar to how we did Moksha Patam: instead of looking at the list of highways to try to map out the graphs, I can instead use a 2d array of ints as a map, where map[i] is an array of integers that is all the cells that i connects to. I'll try to implement this once I get my current code working. |

Now it works for all the small boards, but it fails on large enough boards. I believe this is due to some sort of overflow error; The actual is a negative number, and if I calculate expected - actual, which is how much I'm off by, it gives a very large power of 2. My next plans will be to fix this overflow bug, then convert the program to using a map like I suggested above to decrease runtime for large boards. |

I'm getting index out of bounds errors on enhanced for loops, which I didn't even know was possible and I have no idea how to fix. One test is also running without errors but giving an incorrect answer. No idea why, more investigation needed. I'm also not 100% sure that setting up the map is even faster than just computing in real time, so I'll have to test that. |

It's still slower than it needs to be to pass one of the test cases, and IDK why. I'll have to figure out the big O notation for each step and figure out what step is bringing the algorithm down, then I'll try to fix it. |
