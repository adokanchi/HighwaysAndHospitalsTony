| April 5      |   9-10pm   | I brainstormed some ideas for algorithms on paper. I realized that if I can find out how to find the number of disconnected subgraphs, I could easily solve the problem. Then I tried to implement an algorithm where I figure out how many subgraphs there are by looping through the cities 2d array. As I began writing this work log, I came up with another idea for how to do the project that is similar to how we did Moksha Patam: instead of looking at the list of highways to try to map out the graphs, I can instead use a 2d array of ints as a map, where map[i] is an array of integers that is all the cells that i connects to. I'll try to implement this once I get my current code working. |
